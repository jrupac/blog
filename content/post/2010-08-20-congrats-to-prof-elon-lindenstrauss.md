I just wanted to say congratulations to Professor [Elon Lindenstrauss][1], my
professor for MAT 215, Analysis of a Single Variable, at Princeton.

As of yesterday morning, he is one of the recipients of the [Fields Medal][2]
for 2010 and also the first Israeli mathematician to do so!

It is truly an honor to have been able to be taught by such a great
mathematician.
