I've got a physics midterm tomorrow. Ouch. Â Been working hard at it most
of today and I sure I'll do well tomorrow. Apart from that, it's
another day of programming for me. At the moment, I'm working on the
Facebook Engineering puzzles. I'm regrettably using Java, so extra
optimization of my solutions is a must. Kinda wishing I knew more graph theory
right about now...
