Okay, so I am in no way qualified to make any statements about the veracity of
this, but I think it's kinda important that I put this here.

So today, a story came out about an HP Labs researcher [Vinay Deolalikar][1],
who claims to have a proof that P is not equal to NP (the general consensus in
the community). From what I've read so far about other, more qualified
people commenting on the paper, it does not seem blatantly false or anything.
Which is a great thing to hear.

The paper itself is available [here][2].

Of course the paper itself is well above my head, so I couldn't really get
through much of it. But hopefully, the peer reviewers will have positive things
to say. I'm really keeping my fingers crossed on this one. Will keep tabs
on this one.
