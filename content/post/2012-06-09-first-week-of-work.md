Man, I loved my first week. These past five days marked the first of my 13-week
internship at Google. I had the option between a host in Mountain View or a host
in NYC, and I chose the latter this time.

The team that I'm working on is a part of the Site Reliability Engineering
(SRE) team here at Google, although I can't say much more about the
details of my specific project. It's extremely exciting and I'm
really enjoying it so far! The first few days were rather challenging due to the
nature of how many new things were happeningÂ simultaneously, but I'm told
that's a normal, expected response. I'm reading lots to get up to
speed, and I hope I continue learning lots and gaining some invaluable
experience this summer!
