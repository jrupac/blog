I finally had a bit of spare time today, so I decided to join the [LHC@home][1]
program. For those unfamiliar, it's basically a way for the researchers at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider to utilize the processing capabilities of
thousands of computers distributed across the globe to crunch out all the
calculation that need to be done. As you might expect, each time beams are
collided, there are several terabytes of data created per second and it is the
main task of the physicists at CERN to sift through the endless volumes and look
for evidence of a conjectured, yet not-yet-seen particle called the Higgs Boson.
In addition, there are tons of other experiments and tests done simultaneously.
So, although CERN does have the capacity of a few hundred servers dedicated to
this task, it can do a great deal of good if they can utilize volunteers'
computers too.

LHC@home is similar to other programs such as SETI@home and Folding@home, which
deal with the search for extraterrestrial life and do computations for protein
folding, respectively. I think it's obviously an extremely admirable task
that the folks at CERN are doing and this is one (tiny) way that I'd like
to pitch in.

It's very simple to set up and use. In order to protect their data and the
user's data, all calculations are done inside a virtual machine. Although
this does cause substantial slow-downs, it's worth the risk, as corruption
could create false positive (or worse, false negatives). The VM client used is
VirtualBox, which is a free and very excellent. There's a small client
called BOINC that acts in facilitating the communication between the host
computer and CERN's servers, polling for new jobs, setting up the VM,
running the computation, and sending back results, as well as doing host-side
monitoring, etc. I'm running a laptop with two cores, so I've
decided one core to this program, at most 90% of it, even when the computer is
being used. I've also given it access to my GPU and at most 10GB of space
on my HD. And believe me, it's using every last bit of it. As of this
writing, I've been running my current task for about 2.5 hrs and
it's roughly 10% done. The setup is very painless and you can just watch
it go. All the information about this program (which, by the way, runs on Linux,
Mac OS, and Windows) is available [here][2].

One final note: as a volunteer, you can choose a team to work with on this. Go
Team Carl Sagan!

I'll leave you with a screenshot of how it looks on my laptop.
