This Saturday marked the start of this year's Google Code Jam. It's
bascially this big worldwide competition that anyone can participate in.
Essentially, you can use any freely available language and any IDE/OS/Text
Editor/Compiler you want to produce your code. You think you have a solution and
then you download a Small Input file, after which you have four minutes to
submit the corresponding output file along with your source code. Then
there's a Large Input file for which you have eight minutes to solve. The
questions are basically algorithmic in nature and cover the usual CS contest
topics. Efficiency is somewhat important for the small input and critical for
the second. So anyway yesterday was the Qualifying Round, which was 24 hrs long
and consisted of three questions. I ended up solving all three small inputs
correctly and submitted one large input which was correct. I also solved another
large input but not in enough time :(. In the next few posts, I'll post my
solutions and explanations. But as a result of my solutions, I did qualify for
the next round! It's in about 13 days time and obviously will be way
tougher, but I'm looking forward to it! It was awesome fun working on
these solutions and actually rather re-energizing regardless of the ridiculous
anxiety caused by the momentary latency between submission and result (on the
order of ~0.5s). Updates coming soon!
