This past week, I've been kept busy by attending a workshop on
approximation algorithms, hosted by the [Computational
Intractibility](http://intractability.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.
The particular workshop is this
[one](http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2010/07/workshop-approximation-algorithms-the-last-decade-and-the-next/)
, the purpose being to recap the last decade of advances in this field and to
set the direction for the future. It was a five-day workshop with something like
thirty speakers in total, with talks ranging from 35 minutes to an hour. It was
my first major workshop that I have ever attended!  It happened somewhat
coincidentally, as I had emailed someone from the department for something
totally irrelevant and got a reply regarding it from my professor for the
approximation algorithms class I took last semester - he encouraged me to attend
the workshop this week if I was available and so I did.  There were maybe three
or four undergraduate students apart from me at the conference and it was pretty
amusing to have every conversation start with "So which year of the PhD
program are you at?"

There were some really quite amazing talks, such as one by Vijay Vazirani who
did a overview of how much progress has been made on the twenty-one problems he
predicted last decade would be the major ones in the field (at least 16 of them
have either been conclusively solved or made substantial progress upon). It was
a pretty exciting lecture and what was really cool was that the name "Vazirani"
had come up again and again when we were studying approx.  algorithms in class
and it was pretty amazing to see him in person. He was also one of the three
authors of the famous KVV Theorem (Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani) that gave an optimal
result for any approximation algorithm for online bipartite matching. That
theorem came up over and over again in other talks too.

Another cool talk was by Subhash Khot, inventor of the [Unique Games
Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture) in his seminal
paper, **On the power of unique 2-prover 1-round Games**. He reported on
progress on the relations of UGC to other problems.  Indeed this conjecture as
well made its way into a good number of other talks. I had only very vaguely
heard about UGC before this, but after hearing so much about how powerful it is,
it's pretty amazing. It ties in to a bunch of other theorems (If UGC is true,
then ...) and all of the results we've seen so far (that I'm aware of) derive
reasonable conclusions with the assumption of UGC. It's more evidence that it's
probably true and if it were ever proven to be so, it would represent a major
step forward in this field (and as one speaker said, if it were false, we'd
basically be back at square one).

My professor gave a talk on finding dense subgraphs inside graphs. He converted
the problem into a decision problem of whether or not we can distinguish whether
or not a graph has a dense $k$-subgraph (basically a set of $k$ vertices with a
lot of edges between them). It was mostly understandable because I have a tiny
bit of background in graph theory, but nonetheless a very difficult problem
indeed. The talk was really interesting and it was a shame it was so short.

There were other talks by people from Google Research, Microsoft Research Labs,
Bell Labs, and several universities around the world. I really wish I could
explain every single talk that was given over the five days, but unfortunately
my memory does not serve so well. The take-home message for me was that this is
a truly exciting field and one that is filled with many, many brilliant people
(duh) and that is being so very actively developed upon. It was an overall
awesome experience to be in the company of such great researchers. I just wish I
knew more than I did so I could gain more from attending. But that's what
the future is for!
