Hey so there's a couple updates I wanted to talk about here.

First, let me address the title. Right, so I was selected to be one among the
team of 15 students chosen around the world to participate in the latest Mozilla
Labs Concept Series project, called "The Crowdsourcing Project". You
can check out our homepage right over [here][1] for more details about the
project, but i'll copy-paste the Overview here for convenience:

> The Mozilla Labs [Concept Series][2] and [Design Challenges][3] are
> initiatives in the area of [open innovation][4] and [crowdsourcing][5]. Though
> both initiatives are fairly popular, we believe that they could do even
> better. Main opportunities are in the areas of overall participation as well
> as interaction & collaboration (turning ideas into concepts and prototypes)
> and tooling & scalability (see our [presentation][6] for details).
> 
> The Mozilla Labs "Crowdsource Crowdsourcing" Project aims to bring students
> from leading universities together; to perform a status quo/gap analysis,
> collect and analyze best practices, develop ideas & concepts, run experiments
> and gather user feedback to develop and implement a best in class open
> innovation / crowdsourcing program.

To put it shortly, this is _exactly_ the kind of project that I am interested
in. There's a lot of potential in crowds and that is exactly what we are seeking
to bring out here. So far, since we just started, there's not a lot of updates
yet. But once the ball gets rolling, I'll be sure to tell more about my
progress.  I'm also hoping to do some guest blogging about the project on the
Mozilla Labs blog, so that'll be very cool.

That's the major news for now. I'll probably post again soon with
more updates and thoughts about my research.
