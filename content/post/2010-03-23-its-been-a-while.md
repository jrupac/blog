Before college, I was kinda stuck between studying math, physics, and comp sci.
There were aspects of all that I really liked but I couldn't quite
pinpoint what it was in particular that ticked me. One semester having passed
and neck-deep in the second, I've got it now. I have no idea how long
this'll last but I sure hope it does stay this way, considering it's
about time I started shifting my life towards it. What I'm talking about
is computer science. I've found that it is this that inspires me more than
anything else I've studied thus far at Princeton. If it's one thing
I've realized, it's that you really learn a LOT here. Classes go by
really fast, professors are always eager to move on to the next big topic, and
it's sometimes hard to catch a break. I was thinking the other day and
realized what my ideas about Princeton were: The way I'd say it is:
Princeton for me is about tiredness, stress, exhaustion, pain, and absolute awe.
It's the last one that makes it all worthwhile. The best example I can
currently think of is my comp sci class itself. Early in the morning, I have to
bike uphill quite a bit and quite fast in order to get to class on time. I get
there and I'm always gasping for breath, aching from riding so fast, and
if it's cold or rainy, I'm fairly miserable. But when I actually do
walk into class and my professor gets into the lecture, I realize why it is
that in my mind, the gains outweigh the costs. There's something quite
quirky, strange, and magical about the world and I'm beginning to see it
unraveled piece by piece. More to come.
