I'll write more later on but I just wanted to give a quick update on how
my summer has been going. So I've started my research at Princeton about
three and a half weeks ago and so far it's going pretty well. Mostly
it's a lot of data analysis work and a fair bit of programming.
That's a very good thing. Honestly the more I think about it the more I
realize that programming is what I love more than anything else. I'm
effectively thinking about programming all the time anyway, always trying to
look at the world through the lens of computer science (of what little I know of
it) and so to have the opportunity to actually do it for the summer is quite
cool. I'm working on servers running a variety of 64-bit Linux flavors,
most of which have at least four cores and 8 gigs of RAM. The computational
capacity of them is really amazing and the ability to run in parallel at
acceptable speeds makes life easier. I'm extremely happy with the tools
I'm using - straight manual Makefiles, gcc, gdb, and emacs/vim. As
far as code is concerned, it's mostly C, some Java, and very often Bash
scripts with occasional AWK or Perl for quick things. For some reason I've
found this setup more easy to work with than an actual high-powered IDE. Weird,
perhaps, but I sure hope wherever I work in the future I will be afforded this
same luxury. 

The more I work with Linux, the more advantages I see. I was comfortable with
Bash coming in this summer and I've learned even more after working
exclusively with it. Linux feels like it was designed solely for the purpose of
making a programmer's easier and its done a great job at that. I've
learned a lot more of Bash scripting now and I'm always amazed at how
powerful it is. It's an extremely useful language to know. For source
control, I pretty much had the choice of deciding what I wanted to use and I
chose SVN although I think I should've perhaps gone with Git. It's
been many months since I've used SVN but it was very easy to catch on
again. It also forces me to be organized with my code and be more standardized
so I'm not going to complain :).

For collaboration, I suggested we use Google Wave to keep a running to-do list
and so far it's working beautifully. It really is the best way to keep
track of ideas (although I still maintain an ongoing to-do list on the
whiteboard and on my Google Tasks because I'm weird like that). Checking
off completed items is pretty damn thrilling - I love the feeling of
making progress. 

Apart from working on my current research, I'm also doing some light
QA/Testing for Mozilla. I'm on the nightly builds (Minefield) on my Linux
and Windows 7 partitions (though I use (Linux almost always). But I think
that's helpful here because there are far fewer Linux testers anyway.
Mostly it's just running Litmus tests, benchmarks, and giving feedback on
UI/UX changes as they appear and/or break :). It's a cool feeling to get
daily updates and check out what new patches were made and to see the design
process through the eyes of the developers. I'm also running on the dev
branch of Google Chrome and there too it is interesting to witness the evolution
of the interface and behavior. One day I imagine myself actually a developer at
one of these companies, pushing out updates to millions of users&#8230;
that's something I like to think about everyday. I know it's silly
but I get a kick out of pretending that every commit I make has some tremendous
influence. Maybe one day it will be so and all this is good preparation for that
I guess :). 

This summer my main goals are to of course continue my research but also to
learn Python and master C++ properly. I have a somewhat adequate knowledge of
C++ right now but I never learned it formally - I want to take this summer
to actually learning the finer details of the language. Being that many, many
applications are written in that language and that it's widely the most
popular language for programming contests too, it is certainly worth learning.
As far as Python, I know that I won't regret learning that. Seeing how
much I've come to respect the power of quick and dirty Bash scripts, I
know I'll love the even greater power, flexibility, and ease of use of
Python. A few of my friends are learning it too this summer, some for whom it is
their first language and this further motivates me to learn it. 

I'm going to be taking next week off from research for precisely these
reasons among others. Princeton has really tired me out a great deal and I need
some time to rest and regroup. I hope to take it a lot easier and to get started
on learning those languages. I've also got to continue work on the
Princeton Math Club blog. For that, I'm thinking of implementing the new
Post Type feature that WordPress 3.0 brings. And for that, I need to polish up
some PHP skills and get to work hacking away at the current theme. Looks rather
straightforward so it shouldn't take too long to do. 

Okay so this post is freaking long and not quick at all. It also took quite a
while to type out since I wrote it from the WordPress app on my Droid. More on
  that in an upcoming post. But for now, that's about it.
