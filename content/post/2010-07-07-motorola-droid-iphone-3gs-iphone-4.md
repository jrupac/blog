Okay so the deal is that I bought an iPhone 3GS last year after wanting it for a
long time and then I registered for Google I/O and I got a free Droid
(couldn't actually make it to the conference because of a computer science
final) so I didn't get the free HTC Evo) and then now I ordered and
got an iPhone 4 so that's how I have three phones. I'm going to be
selling my 3GS in a few days time and I use my iPhone 4 primarily (seeing as I
don't have service on my Droid). But I wanted to give my impression of
them all since I've had a chance to play with all three. More importantly,
I've had a chance to interact with both iOS 4 and Android 2.1 (and
hopefully soon 2.2) and want to give my impressions on that too.

To put it very plainly, iPhone 4 currently is the winner in my opinion. There
are a lot of reasons for this but I don't believe that's any longer
impossibly far ahead of Android. With the announcement of Froyo at this
year's I/O, I expect that the coming months will bring about some changes
to the mobile landscape. Already, there is talk and rumors about Gingerbread,
the next version of Android, so it is comforting to know that this is not
something that's going to die away soon. But there are certainly some
issues across various levels of the Android experience that are potentially
fatal. 

In its current state, 2.1 Android is not too shabby. The Droid is the first
Android device I've owned and I can easily tell that it is far better than
the first iteration of devices both from a hardware and software perspective. As
expected, it takes a few cycles for any upcoming competitor to catch up to
speed, but it is important to know when to actually stop giving this benefit of
the doubt. And I believe that time is now. 

We've been through a few software releases and with Froyo and onwards,
Android needs to start looking more like a comprehensive mobile operating system
for a variety of users (not just us geeks who can forgive the occasional mishaps
and difficulties) that can stand on its own. It is one thing to gain the
interest of the hacker community and quite another to gain the interest of the
most average user. 

To be short, Android needs more polish in this respect. I know that the
developers are working particularly on UX for Gingerbread but I still think
that's a bit late. To be clear, 2.1 isn't ugly on the whole and is
definitely useable, but the differences are more apparent when compared with iOS
3.x or 4. 

At this point, the glaring omissions have mostly been taken care of and the more
stubtle points need some attention. For one, I just recently discovered that the
Droid has no spellcheck for the hardware keyboard. While this may be a conscious
decision, I can't say I agree with it at all. The truth is that sticking
firmly to philosophies may work great if you're writing the Linux kernel,
but maybe not so for a front-end feature. Our phones should fit our needs and
expectations, which are neither simple nor static. If users are familiar with
and expect spellcheck for hardware keyboards, it better be there. I believe the
success of an end-user product is inversely proportional to the thickness of the
User Manual. In the same vein, Android must recognize that users have already
picked up certain behaviors from using competitors' product -
that's a "skill" that should be taken advantage of. In this
respect, I like that Android has kept with many of the sweeping unofficial
standards. This gives it an edge over competitors who aim to reteach user
interaction. 

Being a Linux user, I guess I have a natural tendency to like Android. After
all, its guts are very much Linux and you can see the characteristics of Linux
in a lot of places. I love the true multitasking and the approach that
notifications have taken. I like that my homescreen is almost desktop-like and
can provide me with customizable and dynamic information, aka widgets. But the
UI needs some help. Consistency is important and in some ways Android currently
fails that. 

The Market is one place that needs the most help. The bag icon to get to the
homepage of the Market is completely unintuitive. The loading bars for app
updates are jerky and inconsistent. The color scheme is quite ugly too. Most
icons are very blurry even when their actual icons when installed are sharp. Not
all apps have screenshots. Perhaps most discouraging is that there are all kinds
of apps that have copyrighted icons or content. 

This last point is important because it represents a larger issue that needs to
be handled. I'm just as much in support of "free as in freedom" as the next FOSS
guy, but something needs to be done about the quality of apps and the content of
apps that break federal copyright laws. For the first point, it is again a
consistency issue. There's a reason iOS 4 looks so good - the apps are clean and
in tune with the design principles laid down by the OS. In Android, many apps
outside the ones by large organizations honestly look quite bad. Misaligned text
boxes and ill-placed dropdowns and radio buttons evoke a particularly strong
GeoCities-esque feel.  The objective of a drag-and-drop UI should be to not
betray that it is so.  Again, the user should never need to learn how to use an
app. And this is of particular importance because individual developers are of
great value in this open system. We need to make sure all apps make _our_ OS
look good. And for the second issue, I'm starting to wonder if some sort of
approval process might be a good idea - if at least to keep out the malicious
and illegal content. Surely Google can do this - Apple has done so for every one
of its apps and there are twice as many of those. There needs to be more
accountability in this respect and more incentive to stick to the design
principles. Perhaps a section specficially to highlight great interfaces. The
point is that we can't make this a functional collaborative system unless
we actually collaborate. 

The next issue is fragmentation. This is well-known and progress has already
made on this front. I support the regular updates but delivery needs to be sped
up (Google, us Droid owners want Froyo already!). For this aspect,
Android's greatest strength is its weakness. The fact that the theme can
be so customized causes huge delays for phones with Sense, Blur, etc. That
process needs to be streamlined. Further, new versions need to stop making so
many older phones obselete! This of course is not just Google's
responsibility. Hopefully these issues will get ironed out with the next
release. 

I know that's a lot of criticism, but it is just that I've skipped
over all the good stuff, which greatly exceeds the length of this list. I really
like Android and want more than anything to see it do great. And I think it
will.
