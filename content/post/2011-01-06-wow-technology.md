It's days like this that I wish so damn much that I could go to events
such as [CES (Consumer Electronics Show) 2011](http://www.cesweb.org/), going on
right now. One day, I swear I'll go. Really.

I was just reading my usual roundup of tech blogs for the day and couldn't
help but realize that I got just about 217 items just in the past 24 hours
regarding CES and all the ridiculously cool new technology they're
featuring there. Take for example Sony's 27(!) new HDTVs, many of which
are 3D-enabled and all of which are incredibly elegant-looking. Or
Samsung's new razor-thin televisions (seriously, how much thinner can they
make it?). Or the tons of new cameras and camcorders, now at a phase where 10MP
is just barely making it (yes, I know pixel quantity is not everything, but it
does count for something). Or like the dozens and dozens and dozens of new
phones featured today. Like that new Motorola Droid Bionic with 1080p output.
Seriously? Full HD output from a freaking phone?! Wow. (I'm looking at
you, rate-limited HDMI-output Evo).

And the elephant in the room for me, the announcement of Android 3.0, or
Honeycomb, for tablets. To be completely honest, I'm not totally quite
into this tablet frenzy that's been stirred up in the past few months with
everyone and their mother announcing a new tablet, but if there's anything
like Honeycomb running on it, I might just be interested. Arguably, the Galaxy
Tab running Froyo is the best Android tablet on the market (are there others?
Yes there are. Very few). But I played with one and felt like it was a bit of a
letdown. For one, it was just too laggy for my taste and the cosmetic changes
that made it distinctive from a large phone (iPad?) were too minimal. However,
the new sneak peak of Honeycomb on the [Google
Mobile](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/) blog today is pretty impressive. Of
course the video is extremely and almost annoyingly flashy enough to be taken
straight out of Tron, but it gave a pretty neat exposition into how Android will
look on a completely different form factor. I entirely disagree with Apple's UX
choice to literally scale up the exact iPhone interface for the iPad. A
dedicated OS for specifically that form factor is the right idea and I think
Honeycomb is looking good so far.

It also shows the power of Android at extensibility to different kinds of
hardware. About a month back, Google so kindly sent me a free Google TV device
(the [Logitech Revue](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/smartTV/revue)) for my
contributions to Google Code and I got around to playing with it. Initially, I
thought this was just a simple, standalone OS/firmware but quickly realized that
it was actually Android 2.1.  When I played around with the interface, I
actually didn't believe it until I saw the version number on the device itself.
Needless to say, it looked and felt entirely different (although imperfect in a
couple of ways). Now we will soon have a version of Android designed
specifically for tablets. Which brings me to the next question. Where does
Google Chrome OS play into all of this? From whatever I've read, there seems to
be a bit of ideological gap between the Google Chrome OS team and the Android
team as far as objectives.  Yes, they're different but they're also getting
closer and closer to the same types of hardware. I could definitely seen Chrome
OS running on a tablet device (since a fair assumption is that a portable device
like that will be always connected to the Internet). So eventually one is going
to win. Now if only I got one of those CR-48 netbooks, I might be able to pick a
side fairly..
