This weekend consisted of me doing massive amounts of coding and not much else.
We have an assignment due date coming up for my [Introduction to Programming
Systems][1] class. It involves converting a simply C program into IA-32 assembly
and then optimizing the hell out of it. I've gotten it down quite a bit,
but I still want to do better. I can't post any more details about my
specific implementation or anything, but I've got to say this is my
favorite assignment thus far in this class. I'll be posting my plans for
next semester in an upcoming post. I really have to get back to work now, but I
just wanted to try out posting some code, as I will posting relevant snippets in
the future of things I find interesting, etc.
