Wow, crazy. [PUMaC][1] is set to begin in under 24 hours! As I've
mentioned before, PUMaC is Princeton University's annual mathematics
competition intended for high-schoolers (and brilliant middle-schoolers) around
the country and world. It's been an exciting journey thus far and
I've had a great time working with the director and other core PUMaC staff
to bring it all together. I haven't seen the problems yet, but I've
taken a peek at the Power Round test (already handed out to teams last Saturday)
and it looks pretty interesting! The topic this year is in the land of graph
theory: specifically, minor graphs.

According to the latest numbers, we're expected 500+ middle-/high-school
students on campus tomorrow! It's pretty exciting recalling how much I
looked forward to PUMaC, HMMT, and others when I was in high school. Regardless
of how fun it is to organize everything, nothing beats actually competing.  I
hope everyone has a great time tomorrow and we see some fierce competition for
the top spots!
