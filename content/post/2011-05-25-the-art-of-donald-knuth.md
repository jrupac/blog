The other day I had a few extra minutes before heading off for work so I decided
to take a trip to my Engineering Library to check out a book I wanted to study
over the summer. The book was called [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](
http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738)
by Christopher Bishop. It's preparation for a class I'm taking next
semester called Advanced Probabilistic Modeling. Anyway, they didn't have
it. So instead I just figured I'd kill some time by checking out the usual
sections of the library. I stumbled upon a book called the **ACM Turing Award
Lectures: The First Twenty Years: 1966-1985**. Seemed interesting enough to pick
up for a quick glance and I happened to check out Knuth's Turing Award lecture.
I really enjoyed reading the lecture and came across a lot of ideas that I've
been trying to say before on this blog, although not nearly as eloquently as
that of Knuth.  To give a brief summary, the title of the lecture was Computer
Programming as an Art, a theme that no doubt very closely resembles Knuth's
thoughts in writing his AoCP series. Anyway, I really should have read a lot of
this before because I found it very inspiring. I'm going to just list a few nice
quotations from the talk below:

> Implicit in these remarks [that computer programming needs to made more into a
> science as opposed to an artistic, or imprecise, process] is the notion that
> there is something undesirable about an area of human activity that is
> classified as an "art" it has to be a Science before it has any
> real stature. On the other hand, I have been working for more than 12 years on
> a series of books called "The Art of Computer Programming." People
> frequently ask me why I picked such a title; and in fact some people

> least one bibliography reference to some books called "The Act of
> Computer Programming."

I thought this was quite interesting. It seems pretty clear to me that Knuth was
a revolutionary in his thinking regarding programming, even when the notion of
telling a computer a list of instructions to execute was something very new. I
guess the process that the world took to master (if you can call it that now)
the techniques of programming pretty nicely resembles, almost fractal-like, the
process of learning of a single individual learning it for himself. That is, it
starts by taking a bunch of seemingly random words, characters, numbers and
putting them together in some haphazard fashion until the compiler stops yelling
at you. Then the individual learns that in fact there is more rigor to the
process than just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. There
is the evolution of the learning process from chaos to some order; a science if
you want to call it that. But that's very much only the first stages.
Because beyond the beginning stages, everyone pretty much gets how syntax works
and where to put your semi-colons and whatnot. It's the _style_ which is
where the fun really comes in. And you may be able to define how many spaces
there are in a hard tab or where to put your braces in some document, but the
approach by which one tackles a problem is much more innate. That's how we
have neat little algorithms to do our bidding instead of trying to crunch out
everything the brute-force way each and every time. Herein lies the
transformation from a rigorous science back into something of an art form. I
would argue, therefore, that the art of computer programming is an evolution
from the science of computer programming, not its predecessor. Expanding on this
a bit further is another quote:

> It seems to me that if the authors I studied were writing today, they would
> agree with the following characterization: Science is knowledge which we
> understand so well that we can teach it to a computer; and if we don't
> fully understand something, it is an art to deal with it.

I kind of like this definition actually. It ties in with my previous post about
potential functions and how there is an element of creativity necessary to
actually do something of substantial value in this field (as with any!). But
therein lies the fun of it. To put it shortly, there's gotta be a reason
we still have humans instead of computers writing computer programs. Related to
this idea is the following quotation:

> The field of "automatic programming" is one of the major areas of
> artificial intelligence today. Its proponents would love to be able to give a
> lecture entitled "Computer Programming as an Artifact" (meaning
> that programming has become merely a relic of bygone days), because their aim
> is to create machines that write programs better than we can, given only the
> problem specification. Personally I don't think such a goal will ever be
> completely attained, but I do think that their research is extremely
> important, because everything we learn about programming helps us improve our
> own artistry.

I totally loved the above quote. I think it does a great job of highlighting
exactly what this whole post, and probably this blog, is about. The point here
is that reading this speech has provided me with quite a bit of more
inspiration. There is something quite nice about reading these words.

Finally, in closing, here's the quote that explains, in part, the
inspiration for the title of this post:
